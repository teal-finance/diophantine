**Diophantine** is a pure Go lib and CLI to approximate a floatting number (`0.770507`)
by a fraction of two integers (e.g. `7/9`), also known as rational approximation,
fraction approximation or ratio approximation. Diophantine use the functions of two other projects:

- [github.com/bodokaiser/approx](https://github.com/bodokaiser/approx)
- [github.com/pnelson/fraction](https://github.com/pnelson/fraction)

The name is from the [**Diophantine** approximation](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Diophantine_approximation)
named after [Diophantus of Alexandria](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Diophantus_of_Alexandria),
a mathematician in the [Roman Empire](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Roman_Empire?lang=en),
who was the author of books called [*Arithmetica*](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Arithmetica).
Diophantus was the first Greek mathematician who recognized fractions as numbers.
His books have been translated to Arabic during the [Islamic Golden Age](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age),
then translated to Latin during the [Renaissance](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Renaissance).
