# Diophantine

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/teal-finance/diophantine.svg "Go documentation for Diophantine")](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/teal-finance/diophantine)

Diophantine is a pure Go lib and tool to approximate a real number
by a fraction of two rational numbers, also known as rational approximation,
fraction approximation or ratio approximation.

The name is from the [Diophantine approximation](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Diophantine_approximation).

Diophantine use the functions of two other projects:

- [github.com/bodokaiser/approx](https://github.com/bodokaiser/approx)
- [github.com/pnelson/fraction](https://github.com/pnelson/fraction)

## CLI

Example:

    $ go run github.com/teal-finance/diophantine/cmd@latest -list 0.770507 -farey -phil
